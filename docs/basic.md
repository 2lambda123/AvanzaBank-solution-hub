This section describes how to start using XAP Repositories by defining query methods. The basic concept is: user defines methods using a specific query syntax as method name, the XAP repository proxy then derives these methods into XAP queries. Full explanation of this mechanism can be found at [Spring Data Reference](http://docs.spring.io/spring-data/data-commons/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories.query-methods). In this document only basic usage will be explained.
