The Spring Data XAP applies Spring Framework concepts to the development of applications that use XAP In-Memory Data Grid (IMDG) as a data store. We support Spring Data high-level abstractions to simplify configuration and development.

This document is the reference guide for Spring Data XAP. It explains basic and advanced configuration and usage of XAP IMDG features. It omits the concepts of Spring Data, XAP and XAP IMDG, assuming the reader already has a basic familiarity with the [Spring Framework](http://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/reference/html/) and [XAP application development](http://docs.gigaspaces.com/xap100/).
