This part of the document explains how to configure and start using XAP Repositories with Spring Data. While one can try to directly operate with `SpaceClient` created from the [previous section](#support) to perform read and write operations, it is generally easier to use Spring Data Repositories for the same purposes. This approach significantly reduces the amount of boilerplate code from your data-access layer as well as gives you more flexibility and cleaner code which is easy to read and support.

To start with handy Spring Data XAP features you will need to create your repository interface extending `XapRepository` and tell Spring Container to look for such classes.

An example of such user-defined repository with no additional functionality is given below:
```java
${PersonRepository.java}
```
> Note that you define the type of data to be stored and the type of it's id.

##### Registering XAP Repository using XML-based metadata

While you can use Springâ€™s traditional `<beans/>` XML namespace to register an instance of your repository implementing `XapRepository` with the container, the XML can be quite verbose as it is general purpose. To simplify configuration, Spring Data XAP provides a dedicated XML namespace.

Here what your configuration should look like after adding `xap-data:repositories` with proper namespace:
```xml
{...coming soon...}
```
> Note that Spring Container will search for interfaces extending `XapRepository` in package and it's subpackages defined under `base-package` attribute.

##### Registering XAP Repository using Java-based metadata

To achieve the same configuration with Java-based bean metadata, simply add `@EnableXapRepositories` annotation to configuration class. The final version of it should look like this:
```java
{...coming soon...}
```
> Note that `base-package` can be defined as a value of `@EnableXapRepositories` annotation.
