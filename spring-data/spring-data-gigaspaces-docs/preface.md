## <a name="preface"/>Preface

The Spring Data Gigaspaces applies Spring Framework concepts to the development of applications that use Gigaspaces In-Memory Data Grid (IMDG) as a data store. We support Spring Data high-level abstractions to simplify configuration and development.

This document is the reference guide for Spring Data Gigaspaces. It explains basic and advanced configuration and usage of Gigaspaces IMDG features. It omits the concepts of Spring Data, Gigaspaces  IMDG, assuming the reader already has a basic familiarity with the [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework) and [Gigaspaces application development](http://docs.gigaspaces.com/latest/dev-java/).
